Abstract: This paper mainly investigates how various social backgrounds of Liberian women affect their use of contraceptive methods. By data analysis, we conclude that age, level of education, number of current living children and tribes largely influence peopleâ€™ use of birth control. As a rising social issue, helping more people to realize the importance of modern contraception was a necessary step toward population control. From the result of this paper, we could identify groups of individuals that need more education on modern contraception and make relevant public policies to tackle this problem.
